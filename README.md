# mini_shell_42
I designed and developed a basic shell program that allowed users to
interact with their operating system using a command-line interface. I
implemented the ability to execute basic commands and handle input/
output redirection using my knowledge of C programming and the Unix shell.
Through this project, I honed my C programming skills and gained practical
experience with the Unix shell.
